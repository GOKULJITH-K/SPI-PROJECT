# üîó APB-SPI Protocol Project

This repository contains the design, simulation, and implementation of an **APB-based Serial Peripheral Interface (SPI) Core**.  
The project integrates the well-known **SPI communication protocol** with the **AMBA APB bus**, making it highly suitable for use in **SoC (System-on-Chip)** and **embedded systems**.  

The work involves **RTL design in Verilog**, **verification using testbenches**, **linting with SpyGlass**, and **synthesis using Synopsys DC Shell**.  
This document serves both as a **technical overview** and as a **user guide** for the project.

## üìò 1. SPI Protocol ‚Äì Detailed Explanation

The **Serial Peripheral Interface (SPI)** is a **synchronous serial communication protocol** developed by Motorola in the 1980s. It has since become one of the most widely adopted methods for short-distance communication between **controllers (masters)** and **peripherals (slaves)**.  

SPI is designed to be:  
- **Fast**: Supports speeds up to tens of Mbps.  
- **Simple**: Uses only four essential signals.  
- **Flexible**: Works with multiple modes and word lengths.  
- **Efficient**: Transfers data continuously with little overhead.  

### 1.1 SPI Signals
The SPI bus consists of four key signals:
- **SCLK (Serial Clock):** Clock signal generated by the master. Defines the timing of data transfers.  
- **MOSI (Master Out, Slave In):** Data sent from master to slave.  
- **MISO (Master In, Slave Out):** Data sent from slave to master.  
- **SS/CS (Slave Select / Chip Select):** Active-low signal used to select a slave device.  

### 1.2 Working Principle
The operation of SPI can be summarized as follows:
1. The master configures the communication parameters (clock polarity, clock phase, baud rate).  
2. The master selects a slave by pulling its **SS line low**.  
3. The master generates **clock pulses (SCLK)**.  
4. On each clock edge:
   - The master shifts out one data bit on **MOSI**.  
   - The slave shifts out one data bit on **MISO**.  
   - Both sample incoming data from each other.  
5. After the required number of bits (commonly 8), both devices have exchanged one complete word.  
6. The master releases the slave by setting **SS high**.  

This results in **full-duplex communication**, meaning the master and slave send and receive data simultaneously.

### 1.3 SPI Modes
SPI provides four modes of operation, determined by **Clock Polarity (CPOL)** and **Clock Phase (CPHA)**.  
This ensures compatibility with different devices that require data sampling on different edges of the clock.  

| Mode | CPOL | CPHA | Clock Idle | Data Sampled On | Data Changed On |
|------|------|------|-------------|-----------------|-----------------|
| 0    | 0    | 0    | Low         | Rising edge     | Falling edge    |
| 1    | 0    | 1    | Low         | Falling edge    | Rising edge     |
| 2    | 1    | 0    | High        | Falling edge    | Rising edge     |
| 3    | 1    | 1    | High        | Rising edge     | Falling edge    |

## ‚öñÔ∏è 2. Comparison with Other Protocols

SPI is often compared with other serial communication protocols like **I¬≤C** and **UART**. Each has unique advantages, disadvantages, and use cases.  

| Feature         | **SPI**               | **I¬≤C**                       | **UART**              |
|-----------------|----------------------|------------------------------|----------------------|
| Communication   | Synchronous, full-duplex | Synchronous, half-duplex      | Asynchronous, full-duplex |
| Wires Needed    | 4 (MOSI, MISO, SCLK, SS) | 2 (SDA, SCL)                 | 2 (TX, RX)           |
| Speed           | 1‚Äì100 Mbps (typical) | 100 kbps ‚Äì 3.4 Mbps          | Up to ~1 Mbps        |
| Multi-Slave     | Yes (with SS per slave) | Yes (addressing support)      | No (point-to-point)  |
| Distance        | Short (PCB level)    | Medium (~1 m)                 | Long (cables, RS-232)|
| Error Handling  | None built-in        | ACK/NACK support              | Optional parity bit  |
| Hardware Cost   | Low                  | Medium (requires pull-ups)    | Low                  |

üëâ **Key Insights:**  
- SPI is the **fastest** and most efficient, but requires more pins and separate SS lines for each slave.  
- I¬≤C is slower but supports many devices with only two wires.  
- UART is simple and reliable for **point-to-point long-distance** communication but cannot support multiple devices on one bus.

## üìú 3. Project Overview

This project implements a **custom APB-SPI Core** in Verilog.  

The objective is to create a **synthesizable and configurable SPI controller** that integrates with the **AMBA APB bus**, making it directly usable in SoC and FPGA-based designs.  

The project includes:  
- **Design of RTL modules**: interface, baud generator, slave select, shifter, and top-level.  
- **Testbenches** for simulation and functional verification.  
- **Linting** with Synopsys SpyGlass to ensure coding style and design rule compliance.

- Generates control signals for other blocks based on register values.
